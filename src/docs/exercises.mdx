## Chapter VII

### Punctuate

1. <br />
   In 1788 the King's advisers warned him that the nation was facing bankruptcy therefore
   he summoned a body called the States-General believing that it would authorize
   him to levy new taxes. The people of France however were suffering from burdensome
   taxation oppressive social injustice and acute scarcity of food and their representatives
   refused to consider projects of taxation until social and economic reforms should
   be granted. The King who did not realize the gravity of the situation tried to
   overawe them collecting soldiers in and about Versailles where the sessions were
   being held. The people of Paris seeing the danger organized militia companies
   to defend their representatives. In order to supply themselves with arms they
   attacked the Invalides and the Bastille which contained the principal supplies
   of arms and munitions in Paris.

2. <br />
   On his first continental tour begun in 1809 Byron visited Portugal Spain Albania
   Greece and Turkey. Of this tour he composed a poetical journal Childe Harold's
   Pilgrimage in which he ascribed his experiences and reflections not to himself
   but to a fictitious character Childe Harold described as a melancholy young nobleman
   prematurely familiar with evil sated with pleasures and embittered against humanity.
   The substantial merits of the work however lay not in this shadowy and somewhat
   theatrical figure but in Byron's spirited descriptions of wild or picturesque
   scenes and in his eloquent championing of Spain and Greece against their oppressors.
   On his return to England in 1811 he was persuaded rather against his own judgment
   into allowing the work to be published. Its success was almost unprecedented in
   his own words he awoke and found himself famous.
